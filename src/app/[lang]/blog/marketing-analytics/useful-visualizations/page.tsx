          Useful Visualiations for Marketing Analytics
        </h1>
        <p>
          In this article, I have compiled a list of useful visualizations and
          statistics for marketing/customer analytics. I will provide a short
          description and explanation for each of them and describe the
          scenarios in which they are useful. I have tried to focus on charts
          that are specific to marketing analytics and ones that are more
          interesting than your standard bar/line/scatter plot.

            Disclaimer: This article is a work-in-progress and I will add new
            visualizations and statistics as time goes by (and as I discover
            them myself). You can find the full code that is used to generate
            them on my{" "}

        <h3>Customer Journey Mapping</h3>
        <p>
          The customer journey (CJ) can be understood as the sequence of
          touchpoints, the customer goes through before establishing a
          commercial relationship with the company. In general, we want to graph
          the CJ from a more abstract, high-level point of view. That is, we
          don’t care about every single mouse click the customer made but rather
          about the rough stages through which they transitioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will plot different touchpoints in one dimension and frequencies in
          the other dimension. For this type of chart, we need the aggregated
          interactions of our customer base grouped by touchpoints. The more
          common way of displaying the CJ is via a so-called funnel chart (in
          that case we might also call it a marketing funnel).
        </p>
        <FunnelChart />
        <p>
          An alternative representation of the CJ can be done via Sankey plots.
          These show not only the positive cases (i.e. people who continued to
          the next stage) but also where the people who dropped out went
          instead. Given that I used the same data for both diagrams, there is
          no big difference but if we care about where people who stopped
          interacting went afterwards, a Sankey plot might be the better choice.
          This would also be the case in special situations where not everyone
          has to go through all the stages but rather there are different
          starting points (and maybe even different ‘final’ interactions).
        </p>
        <SankeyPlot />
        <p>
          In the figure below, we can see that there are different ways in which
          people might have gotten to the landing page and also how they
          continued afterward. Very quickly we can see that a lot of the people
          coming from the email campaign churn between the landing page and the
          product page and therefore very few of them make it to the subsequent
          touch points. This is also a good way of comparing the CJ of different
          cohorts (more on cohorts later) or how the CJ improved over time.
        </p>
        <SankeyMulti />
        <p>
          Especially when wanting to compare the CJ across different dimensions
          (e.g. customer groups, demographics, or time) it can become
          inefficient to do so via the visualizations above. It is also hard to
          read precise percentages from the chart and compare them with each
          other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this, we can also summarize the information with some
          metrics and then plot that metric across dimensions (or just put the
          metric as-is on a dashboard as a KPI). Firstly, we can look at the
          overall conversion rate. This is the percentage of users who complete
          the desired action (e.g., making a purchase, signing up) compared to
          the total number of users who started the journey. This is a very
          high-level metric that can be plotted over time to see general trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can also look at this rate for each stage to see where the
          bottlenecks occur. When we take one minus the conversion rate, we get
          the drop-off rate. This is just the percentage of customers that
          abandon the journey (or abandon it at a given stage). The drop-off
          rate at the first touch point is also called the bounce rate (in our
          case this would be the drop-off rate at the landing page). In our
          case, we can see that although much of the blue stream makes it
          through the landing page to the product page (low bounce rate), most
          of them drop-off at the product page and don’t make it to the cart.
          The drop-off rate at the cart is also often called the cart
          abandonment rate. A high rate may indicate friction in the checkout
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is a more complex customer journey with lots of branches and
          different ways of getting to the final touchpoints, one can also
          consider looking at the most common or least common paths. Also, in
          some cases, it might be of interest to know how fast customers reach
          the different touch points and how much time they spend at them. Long
          durations might indicate difficulty in completing the action (or
          again, some friction), while short times might suggest efficient user
          flow or low engagement. In this case, the correct explanation for the
          behavior depends on the specific business context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there is always room for improvement in the CJ and we have
          limited resources (e.g. limited marketing spend), one needs to have
          some way of deciding for which area of the funnel (i.e. touch point)
          or which customer group to optimize first. For this, we can look at
          measures such as customer acquisition cost, average transaction value
          and customer lifetime value (CLV) to see in which areas an improvement
          of the funnel has a high return on investment (ROI). As an example, if
          we have a high bounce rate at one of our touch points but only people
          with a very low CLV are bouncing off, this might now be as bad as
          losing customers that have a high CLV.
        </p>
        <h3>Pareto Charts</h3>
        <p>
          A Pareto chart plots the cumulative percentage as a function of some
          continuous or discrete variable. In our case, we have different
          marketing channels on the x-axis and the cumulative relative number of
          conversions on the y-axis. This enables us to quickly see that email
          marketing and social media make up around 70% of all conversions (also
          called the vital few) whereas the rest of the channels (called the
          useful many) make up around 30%.
        </p>
        <ParetoChart />
        <p>
          The advice then often is to focus on these vital few. But what about
          this chart tells us that focussing on the vital few is the right thing
          to do? There is nothing causal that establishes that investing
          resources in email marketing will lead to an increase in conversions.
          It could just be that further efforts in one of these vital few would
          only give us marginal gains whereas other channels still have some
          potential or might even be ‘low-hanging fruit’. Although the Pareto
          chart is a nice tool for quickly giving us a snapshot of the current
          situation it does not directly give us actionable insights. On the
          other side, it can give a quick overview and could for example show us
          that we have a long right tail with little to no contribution. In our
          case, this would mean having lots of marketing channels on the right
          of the spectrum that contribute very little to the conversions. In
          that case, one can do a deeper analysis to see if having these
          channels is worth the effort of maintaining them (maybe there are
          interaction effects between channels). In either case, the Pareto
          chart can create awareness around such issues.
        </p>
        <h3>(Cohort) Retention Analysis </h3>
        <p>
          Retention analysis is the process of tracking and analyzing customer
          behavior to understand how customers continue to engage with a
          company, product, or service after their initial interaction. It is a
          critical component of understanding customer behavior and ensuring
          long-term business success since acquiring new customers is often more
          expensive than retaining the current ones.

            .
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, we can look at the chart below to get a general feeling for
          how customers interact with the product after signing up. We have the
          relative time (i.e. periods since signing up) on the x-axis and some
          measure for the intensity of interaction on the y-axis. Every line
          represents a single customer.
        </p>

          src={"/blog/useful_viz__customerDynamics.webp"}
          width={400}
          height={400}
          alt="Customer Dynamics"
        />
        <p>
          This is an example with synthetic data but we can see that some
          customers have declining interaction rates (e.g. red) while others
          show a pattern of constant interaction followed by a sudden increase
          in interaction after some time (e.g. green).
        </p>
        <p>
          An obvious drawback is that we can never plot our entire customer base
          since the chart gets messy at around ten customers. If we want to
          measure our entire customer base we will probably have to calculate
          some metrics that summarize the charts seen above. One such method can
          be seen in the chart below. For every customer, we fit a first-order
          polynomial (i.e. just intercept and slope). Note that this is probably
          not a very good description of the customer behavior. It would be
          especially bad at extrapolating since customer activity would be
          predicted to rise indefinitely as time increases. This can be seen in
          the green line below where the activity plateaus but from the line we
          would predict an increase.

          height={400}
        />
        <p>
          Nonetheless, by looking at the slopes, we can estimate how many of our
          customers show an increasing interaction strength and for how many it
          declines.

        <h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>
        <p>
          In many cases, we don’t know along which dimensions we want to look at
          our customers. That is, we don’t already have some way of grouping our
          customers but instead, we want to find such a grouping of customers
          within the data. This post won’t go into the details of the technical
          process of customer segmentation, I just wanted to show one chart I
          found interesting for visualizing the results of a clustering.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each segment (i.e. cluster) the radar chart shows the average
          value of each attribute. We can then try and find a precise label for
          the group. After that, we have created the foundation for being able
          to specifically target each of these groups.
