In essence, it's a way to forecast how much revenue a customer is likely to generate over the course of their interactions with the company.CLV modeling takes into consideration various factors such as historical purchasing behavior, frequency of purchases, average transaction value, customer retention rates, and other relevant metrics to predict the future value of a customer. This information is valuable for businesses in several ways",
